# Overview

This document is the UBC Launch Pad manifesto: a high-level overview of our vision, what we do, our values, and how we work with our sponsors and partners.

> As the leading software development club at UBC, Launch Pad prepares students for the future by providing a space for them to learn and practice industry-standard tools through building projects with like-minded individuals.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to [get in touch](/introduction.md#get-in-touch)!

## What We Did

We are a project-based collaborative software engineering club at UBC. We realize projects at various stages from team ideation to external sponsor projects. We form and recurit teams to take on projects with various timelines to deliver impactiful products. To learn more about how we develop solutions, check here.

As a club, Launch Pad supports every member’s experience through multiple ways:

1. We provide enormous resources (Launch Pad’s database and guidelines) from experienced members to support members in their development process
2. We connect members with industry professionals to learn about the industry skills through internal workshops
3. We design team structure to enable mentorship and multidisciplinary teamwork from their peers
4. We recruit with high standards to ensure everyone in Launch Pad is driven and dedicated in their own expertise

## Club Structure

#### Leadership Team

Launch Pad's Leadership team consist of our [**co-presidents**](#co-presidents), **tech leads**, and **design lead**. Learn more about being on the leadership team in the [leads onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/leads.md), and learn more about how the leadership team is selected in our [recurring processes documentation](/handbook/strategy/recurring-processes.md#selecting-leadership).

#### Co-Presidents

Launch Pad is lead by two co-presidents. The role of the co-presidents is to act as the face of the club, manage our resources and accounts, and help the leadership team feel empowered and supported in initiatives they want to drive. The co-presidents do this by providing the leadership team with whatever guidance and resources they need, such as contacts, accounts, money, advice, and so on. Co-presidents also help ensure Launch Pad's initiatives and activities are aligned with the club's mission and objectives.

Co-presidents also act as leads of the [strategy team](#strategy-team).

#### Project Teams

Launch Pad primarily consists of agile development teams centred around a shared project. Each team consists of a Tech Lead and a number of Developers, usually between 5 to 8. Learn more about being on a project team in the [onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/everyone.md).

**Tech Leads** are experienced developers who are responsible for managing the team by planning the project roadmap, assigning tickets during sprints, and implementing challenging features. They are also available as a resource to less experienced developers on the team. If you have any trouble with your issue, questions about Launch Pad, or just a random technical question: ask your Tech Lead. Learn more about Tech Leads in the [role description](/handbook/recruitment/tech-lead.md).

**Teams** focus on a particular platform or technology, like Android, Web, or Machine Learning, and build a project for that platform. Platform teams are meant to balance learning with creation: teams working together have the ability to build interesting projects, less experienced developers have the opportunity to learn in the process, and more experienced developers get a taste of management and mentoring. Teams aim to model the experience of building a product at a software company. Learn more about Developers in the [developer role description](/handbook/recruitment/developer.md).

#### Design Team

UBC Launch Pad has a Design team that handles designs and asset creation for Launch Pad projects. Each project that requires design help should have one or more designers working with the team. Learn more about the design team in the [design onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/design.md), and designers in the [designer role description](/handbook/recruitment/designer.md).

Each year, one member is appointed as the **Design Lead**. The design lead's role is to support the design team and act as the bridge between the [leadership team](#leadership-team) and designers. Learn more about the Design Leads in the [role description](/handbook/recruitment/design-lead.md).

#### Strategy Team

UBC Launch Pad has a Strategy team that focuses on strategically growing the team. This team will focus on increasing campus awareness and forming strategic partnerships in order to further contribute to Launch Pad's vision to be the leading university technology club in Vancouver, Canada, or maybe even the world. Learn more about being on the strategy team in the [strategy onboarding guide](/handbook/onboarding/strategy.md), and strategy members in the [strategy role description](/handbook/recruitment/strategy.md).

The Strategy team is lead by the [**co-presidents**](#co-presidents).
